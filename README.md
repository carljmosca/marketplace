# AI Unified Process Marketplace

AI Unified Process is a requirements-first workflow for taking software from a product vision to reviewed
specifications, implementation, and traceable tests. This repository distributes the workflow as portable Agent
Plugins and Agent Skills for Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and other
compatible coding agents.

## Why AI Unified Process?

AI-assisted development often jumps from a vague prompt directly to code. AI Unified Process inserts durable,
human-reviewable artifacts between intent and implementation:

- requirements with stable identifiers;
- an explicit domain entity model;
- use cases that define user goals and behavior;
- test journeys that trace back to those use cases;
- stack-specific implementation and tests built from the reviewed specifications.

The workflow is inspired by the phases of the
[Rational Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_unified_process), adapted for coding agents and
plain-text artifacts that live with the source code.

## Workflow

```text
Inception          Elaboration                            Construction
─────────────     ───────────────────────────────────     ─────────────────────────────────
/requirements  →  /entity-model  →  /use-case-diagram  →  /use-case-spec  →  migration
                                                                          ↘  implementation
                                                                          ↘  tests
```

`aiup-core` owns the stack-independent path from vision to specifications. One stack plugin continues from those
specifications into migrations, application code, and tests.

Each step reads the files produced by earlier steps. You can review or edit an artifact before continuing, and every
later result remains traceable to the corresponding requirement or use case.

## Choose your plugins

Install `aiup-core` in every project. Add exactly one stack plugin when AI Unified Process supports the project's implementation
stack.

| Plugin                                      | Stack and responsibility                      | Construction skills                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`aiup-core`](aiup-core/)                   | Stack-independent analysis and specifications | `/requirements`, `/entity-model`, `/use-case-diagram`, `/use-case-spec`, `/test-case`, `/reverse-engineer` |
| [`aiup-vaadin-jooq`](aiup-vaadin-jooq/)     | Vaadin Flow or Hilla with jOOQ                | Flyway, implementation, Browserless or Karibu, Playwright, coverage check                                 |
| [`aiup-angular-jpa`](aiup-angular-jpa/)     | Angular with Spring Boot and JPA              | Flyway, implementation, Spring Boot tests, Vitest, Playwright                                              |
| [`aiup-blazor-dotnet`](aiup-blazor-dotnet/) | C# and Blazor on .NET 10 with EF Core         | EF migrations, Vertical Slices, bUnit, xUnit, Playwright                                                   |
| [`aiup-nestjs-nextjs`](aiup-nestjs-nextjs/) | NestJS and Drizzle with Next.js App Router    | Drizzle migrations, implementation, Vitest, Supertest, React Testing Library, Playwright                   |
| [`aiup-dsl`](aiup-dsl/)                     | Java 21 DSL with ANTLR 4 and Finite State Machines | `/implement-dsl`, `/implement-dsl-mcp`, `/implement-dsl-lsp`, `/implement-dsl-vscode-extension` |

`aiup-vaadin-jooq` additionally ships the read-only [`uc-coverage`](aiup-vaadin-jooq/agents/uc-coverage.md)
sub-agent. It reports which parts of the specification have no code or no test behind them, and which code has no
specification behind it. The [`/coverage-check`](aiup-vaadin-jooq/skills/coverage-check/SKILL.md) skill runs that
audit on demand and judges implementation and tests together; the implementation and testing skills end by handing
off to it rather than running it themselves, so a construction round stays fast.

Use only `aiup-core` when working with another implementation stack. The methodology ends at a documented boundary,
so the specifications can feed a custom implementation workflow.

## Quick start

Before installing AI Unified Process, create `docs/vision.md` in the target project. It should describe the mission, target users,
goals, scope, and constraints. A copy-ready [vision template](docs/templates/vision.md) is available.

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add ai-unified-process/marketplace
/plugin install aiup-core
/plugin install aiup-vaadin-jooq
```

Replace `aiup-vaadin-jooq` with the selected stack plugin.

### Any supported agent through Tessl

```sh
tessl init --agent agents
tessl install ai-unified-process/aiup-core
tessl install ai-unified-process/aiup-vaadin-jooq
```

Tessl installs versioned skills and maps their MCP servers into the configured agent layout.
Replace `agents` with a host-specific identifier such as `claude-code`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `codex`, `copilot`, or
`copilot-vscode` when you do not want the vendor-neutral layout.

### Create the first artifacts

Run the core skills in the target project:

```text
/requirements
/entity-model
/use-case-diagram
/use-case-spec UC-001
```

Agents that do not expose skills as slash commands can invoke them by intent, for example: "Create the requirements
catalog from `docs/vision.md`" or "Specify UC-001".

## Generated artifacts

The stack-independent workflow creates a shared documentation contract:

```text
docs/
├── vision.md                         # maintained by the team
├── requirements.md                   # /requirements
├── entity_model.md                   # /entity-model
├── use_cases.puml                    # /use-case-diagram
├── use_cases/
│   └── UC-001-*.md                   # /use-case-spec
└── test_cases/
    └── TC-001-*.md                   # /test-case
```

Stack plugins consume these files and place generated code and tests according to the conventions of the target
project. Their READMEs document the supported layouts and exact prerequisites.

## Existing applications

Start an undocumented application with:

```text
/reverse-engineer
```

The skill inspects entry points, domain models, schema, authentication, and integrations, then proposes an entity
model, use case diagram, and individual use case specifications. It reports behavior it cannot classify so the team
can review gaps before adopting the result as a baseline.

## Installation

- [Claude Code](docs/installation/claude-code.md) — add the marketplace and install plugins directly.
- [Tessl](docs/installation/tessl.md) — install pinned plugins for one or more supported agents.
- [Agent Plugins and manual setup](docs/installation/other-agents.md) — direct packages, skill locations, MCP examples,
  and host-specific caveats.

Every plugin directory contains:

- a Claude Code manifest and MCP configuration;
- an Agent Plugins v1.0.0 `plugin.json` and `mcp.json`;
- portable Agent Skills under `skills/`;
- sub-agent definitions under `agents/`, where the plugin ships one;
- a Tessl package manifest;
- evaluation scenarios used during publication.

CI keeps the three plugin manifest formats and their MCP definitions in sync, and verifies that every
skill and document carries its copyright header and that each plugin ships `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.

Detailed skill behavior is documented in each plugin's `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Those files are the authoritative source
for inputs, outputs, safety constraints, and execution steps; READMEs provide navigation and concise summaries.
